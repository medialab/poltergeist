He decided on this unusual way to do research after having carried out several fieldwork studies in the domains of the science and legal techniques. Having directed two international exhibitions (Iconoclash 2002 and Making Things Public at the ZKM in Karlsruhe 2005), he found he had a taste for collective work and the exploration of new modes of research and presentation in what are called “the humanities”. In the jargon of research projects, he is the PI (“principal investigator”) of the AIME project, which means he has a hand in everything without knowing very much.",

He hopes that all the new software and modes of collaboration will allow for future methodological changes in the history of the sciences…and hopes to finish his thesis.",

Being involved in every technical decision made by Medialab, he was immediately involved as an advisor in the AIME project. However, as the project grappled with the enormous difficulties and new challenges presented by the ‘digital humanities’ he rapidly took on the role of technical director. If this project can be said to work, it is certainly because thanks to Paul finding a way to coordinate the various professions needed to make this insane endeavor work.",

As he is also working on other projects at Sciences Po, he has also been playing an important role in making this institution one of the most promising sites yet for development of the ‘digital humanities’.",

Agreeing to play the complex role of a mediator in the AIME project, he has been following the modes and how the interplay between them perhaps offers the possibility of another way of describing the vast continent that is the economy. His familiarity with the English-speaking world has been invaluable in helping us guide our English-language readers through the inquiry",

On those questions of fundamental importance to anthropology, he has been able to guarantee that the AIME project has had high quality debates.

As it happens, it is partly due to the fact that Milad, an historian and specialist in ancient texts has become one of the most listened commentators on the changes taking place in digital cultures. It is thus an enormous opportunity for the project to benefit from not only from his keeping a watchful eye on the content but also on the project’s modus operandi. He will be helping the participants to modify the system so as to take maximum advantage of the power of those digital worlds placed at the service of this odd inquiry.",
